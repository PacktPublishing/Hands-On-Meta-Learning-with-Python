**Meta learning using one-shot learning, MAML, Reptile, and Meta-SGD with TensorFlow**

## What is this book about?
Meta learning is an exciting research trend in machine learning, which enables a model to understand the learning process. Unlike other ML paradigms, with meta learning you can learn from small datasets faster.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the basics of meta learning methods, algorithms, and types
* Build voice and face recognition models using a siamese network
* Learn the prototypical network along with its variants
* Build relation networks and matching networks from scratch
* Implement MAML and Reptile algorithms from scratch in Python
